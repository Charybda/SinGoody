# SinGoody
SinGoody is a program which generates music file based on digital score image. It uses basic image operations like thresholding, dilation, erosion. After this operations staffs are detected and separated. Then stafflines are removed from each staff image and symbols are extracted. Convolutional neural network is used to classify symbols. The architecture of CNN was based on the article "Pen-Based Music Document Transcription with Convolutional Nerual Networks" (J. Sober-Mira, J. Calvo-Zaragoza, D. Rizo, J. M. IÃ±esta, https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-02284-6_6). After that notes pitches are determined and with pyFluidSynth (https://pypi.org/project/pyFluidSynth/) .wav file is created.
Main scores which were processed are choir scores where each voice has own staff and there is one melody on one staff.
